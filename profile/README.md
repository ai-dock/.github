# AI-Dock

A collection of containerised AI tools you can run on your own computer or in the cloud.

AI-Dock is committed to making AI and ML accessible to all - Whether you have a high-end GPU or not.

All images are supplied with a `docker-compose.yaml` for easy startup locally (or where you have full control over a remote machine).

Images also support passing environment variables via `docker run` for customisation to ensure compatibility with container cloud providers [vast.ai](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref=62897) & [runpod.io](https://runpod.io/?ref=m0vk9g4f).
 
Images that contain Jupyter are also tested for compatibility with [Paperspace](https://console.paperspace.com/signup?R=FI2IEQI).
